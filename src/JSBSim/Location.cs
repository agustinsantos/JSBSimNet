    /// Location holds an arbitrary location in the Earth centered Earth fixed
    /// reference frame(ECEF). The coordinate frame ECEF has its center in the
    /// middle of the earth.The X-axis points from the center of the Earth towards
    /// a location with zero latitude and longitude on the Earth surface.The Y-axis
    /// points from the center of the Earth towards a location with zero latitude
    /// and 90 deg East longitude on the Earth surface.The Z-axis points from the
    /// Earth center to the geographic north pole.
    /// 
    /// This class provides access functions to set and get the location as either
    /// the simple X, Y and Z values in ft or longitude/latitude and the radial
    /// distance of the location from the Earth center.
    /// 
    /// It is common to associate a parent frame with a location.This frame is
    /// usually called the local horizontal frame or simply the local frame.It is
    /// also called the NED frame (North, East, Down), as well as the Navigation
    /// frame.This frame has its X/Y plane parallel to the surface of the Earth
    /// (with the assumption of a spherical Earth). The X-axis points towards north,
    /// the Y-axis points east and the Z-axis points to the center of the Earth.
    ///
    /// Since the local frame is determined by the location (and NOT by the
    /// orientation of the vehicle IN any frame), this class also provides the
    /// rotation matrices required to transform from the Earth centered(ECEF) frame
    /// to the local horizontal frame and back.This class "owns" the
    /// transformations that go from the ECEF frame to and from the local frame.
    /// Again, this is because the ECEF, and local frames do not involve the actual
    /// orientation of the vehicle - only the location on the Earth surface.There
    /// are conversion functions for conversion of position vectors given in the one
    /// frame to positions in the other frame.
    /// The Earth centered reference frame is NOT an inertial frame since it rotates
    /// with the Earth.
    /// 
    /// The cartesian coordinates (X, Y, Z) in the Earth centered frame are the master
    /// values. All other values are computed from these master values and are
    /// cached as long as the location is changed by access through a non-const
    /// 
    /// member function. Values are cached to improve performance. It is best
    /// practice to work with a natural set of master values.Other parameters that
    /// are derived from these master values are calculated only when needed, and IF
    ///
    /// they are needed and calculated, then they are cached (stored and remembered)
    /// so they do not need to be re-calculated until the master values they are
    /// derived from are themselves changed(and become stale).
    ///
    ///  Accuracy and round off
    /// 
    ///  Given,
    /// - that we model a vehicle near the Earth
    /// - that the Earth surface radius is about 2*10^7, ft
    /// - that we use double values for the representation of the location
    ///
    /// we have an accuracy of about
    /// 
    /// 1e-16*2e7ft/1 = 2e-9 ft
    /// 
    /// left.This should be sufficient for our needs. Note that this is the same
    /// relative accuracy we would have when we compute directly with
    /// lon/lat/radius.For the radius value this is clear.For the lon/lat pair
    /// this is easy to see.Take for example KSFO located at about 37.61 deg north
    ///  122.35 deg west, which corresponds to 0.65642 rad north and 2.13541 rad
    /// west. Both values are of magnitude of about 1. But 1 ft corresponds to about
    /// 1/(2e7*2* pi) = 7.9577e-09 rad.So the left accuracy with this representation
    ///  is also about 1*1e-16/7.9577e-09 = 1.2566e-08 which is of the same magnitude
    /// as the representation chosen here.
    /// 
    /// The advantage of this representation is that it is a linear space without
    /// 
    /// singularities.The singularities are the north and south pole and most
    /// 
    /// notably the non-steady jump at -pi to pi.It is harder to track this jump
    /// correctly especially when we need to work with error norms and derivatives
    /// of the equations of motion within the time-stepping code. Also, the rate of
    /// change is of the same magnitude for all components in this representation
    /// which is an advantage for numerical stability in implicit time-stepping.
    /// 
    /// Note: The latitude is a GEOCENTRIC value.FlightGear converts latitude to a
    ///  geodetic value and uses that. In order to get best matching relative to a
    /// map, geocentric latitude must be converted to geodetic.
